# Learning C, C++, and Data Structures/Algorithms

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains my journey of learning C, C++, and exploring Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm taking a course to enhance my programming skills, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

## About the Repository

In this repository, you'll find a collection of programs, code snippets, and projects that I'm working on as part of my learning journey. These programs cover topics ranging from basic concepts in C and C++ to more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms implementation.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the topics I'm learning. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

- `c-basics`: Basic programs and examples in the C programming language.
- `cpp-basics`: Fundamental concepts and examples in the C++ programming language.
- `data-structures`: Implementation of various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.
- `algorithms`: Implementation of algorithms like sorting, searching, recursion, etc.
- `projects`: Small projects that demonstrate the use of learned concepts.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the folders and programs to understand the concepts I've been working on. You can navigate through the folders and find code examples, comments, and explanations. If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements, don't hesitate to leave a comment or reach out to me.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to iNeuron and Saurabh Shukla Sir for providing valuable learning materials and guidance throughout this journey. I'm looking forward to continuing my learning and sharing more with the community.

Happy coding!
